In today's era of widespread smartphone usage, LINE has become one of the primary channels for communication, and LINE Bots have emerged as a popular interactive platform. This talk will delve into how to integrate the latest generative artificial intelligence technology, specifically the Gemini Pro model, along with the highly efficient programming language Golang, to create more intelligent and engaging LINE Bot applications. By leveraging the advanced deep learning capabilities of Gemini Pro and the high-performance features of Golang, we will demonstrate how to enable LINE Bots to not only conduct natural dialogues but also assist in problem-solving and entertainment across various application scenarios. The presentation will share real-world examples, revealing how the powerful combination of generative AI technology and Golang can be used to develop creative and fun intelligent LINE Bot applications.

## Event Introduction

GopherDay is a small-scale event derived from GopherCon. Since the GopherCon Taiwan in 2020, the Golang Taiwan community has decided to revive its original mission. In this one-day event, Gopher enthusiasts, independent developers, software engineers, data scientists, and DevOps engineers from around the world and Taiwan gather to share their interesting experiences and best practices in using the Go language.
The theme of this year's GopherDay is "**Go Everywhere**", symbolizing the increasing prominence of Golang in various fields and allowing Go to lead us Gophers towards the world.

We welcome Go developers from various fields to submit proposals related to the following topics. We hope that you can share your experiences in Go language development with other members of the global Go community, so that we can learn from each other and exchange the latest trends and application techniques of Go together!

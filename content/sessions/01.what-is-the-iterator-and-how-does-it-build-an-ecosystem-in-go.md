We would be able to use functions in “for range” in Go 1.23.
This feature is known as iterator, you can try it with GOEXPERIMENT=rangefunc in Go1.22.
The maps and slices packages provide functions that return or get an iterator in Go1.23.
For example, maps.Keys returns an iterator of keys instead of a slice.
This session will explain iterators and how to use them.
And I will show my thoughts about an ecosystem built around iterators and related functions.
